# What is it?
The Blobifier is a small device that eliminates the need for a purgeblock, making filament swaps more quick. It does this by extruding filament onto a tray creating a blob that will get ejected into a purge-bucket.

# Credit where credit is due
The Macro is based on a version, and Nozzle Scrubber is made by Hernsl (hernsl#8860 on Discord). 

# Who is it for?
The device is designed around a Voron V2.4 300mm, but should work for 250mm and 350mm too. This version only supports the assembly on the rear-left of the bed. If you decide to change all this, please consider contributing to the project by creating a pull request with the needed changes.

- 1 x M2x4 shsc (For the servo pivot arm)
- 1 x 10x15x1.5mm aluminum strip (for insert in the tray, so the filament doesn't stick to it)
